1. add the following to the config page of the theme in use this will allow th ilp to display with out side bars:

	'ilp' => array(
        'file' => 'standard.php',
        'regions' => array(),
    ),
    
2. I have encountered a problem when creationg reports in sites with low max execution times this is being caused by 
the permissions for reports being created for all roles if the problem occurs raise the max execution time. I changed mine 
from 30 to 90 and it solved the problem
